Building Management companies of residential and mixed-use high rises have solar panel arrays installed on their roofs in order to give electricity back to the grid and minimise electricity bills. Not being domain experts, they lease the panels from a 3rd party service provider that installs, monitors, and fixes them when they break down. We are that 3rd party; we are Arndt.

We have designed a drone-assisted monitoring, dispatch, and remote inspection system that harnesses the power of fog computing which helps technicians keep track of a service networkâ€™s status, get visual feedback and diagnostics, all without requiring costly physical presence on location.

For the purposes of this hackathon, we have tackled the SAAS side of this business and NOT the industrial design of drones themselves.
